# NED (Numeric Entity Doubler) 
NED, an encryption and decryption algorithm rewritten in the Rust programming language. In this version of NED, both ASCII and default encryption/decryption methods are available (similarly to the Desktop version).

## How It Works
- **Input: Z**
- **Key: 10**
- **Recursion: 2**

## Using NED
No runtime is required for this version of NED.

### Precautions
- Only keys between 10 and 74 can be decrypted **without** error.
- High recursions are probably not good to use...

### Accessing The App
- Download the NED executable from the releases page
- Run the NED executable
- Have fun :D

## Planned Updates
- CLI Tools
- File IO
- Password Encryption
